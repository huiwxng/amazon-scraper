I had an issue with amazon returning a 503 error when trying to scrape their site so I used Splash browser (a javascript rendering service wiht an HTTP API) and Docker to host it. I also ran into an issue where some of the HTML elements would not read properly even though they were there. For instance, when I loop through to find divs with this property: 'data-cel-widget': f'search_result_{i}'. search_result_4 would not be found but when I use a query for search_result_5, i would get the result of search_result_4, I just caught the error and moved past the number.
